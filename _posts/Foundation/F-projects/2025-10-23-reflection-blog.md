# üçé Reflection Blog: Learning from My Mistake and Improving as a Teammate  

## üôè Apology and Reflection  

Towards the beginning of class, I was eating my lunch and looking at a piece of paper. I want to sincerely apologize for this behavior. The reason I was eating was because I had a club meeting during lunch and didn‚Äôt have a chance to eat beforehand. I made the wrong decision to start eating my lunch during class. Even though I was still listening to my team and discussing ideas for our project, I recognize that eating in class was disrespectful and distracting. I also understand that it‚Äôs important to give my full attention to the lesson and my group. I won‚Äôt eat during class again, and I‚Äôll continue to actively collaborate in meaningful discussions with my team.  

I was also looking at a piece of paper during class. I had been holding it for a teammate while she was putting her folder away, but I ended up reading it because I was curious about what was on it. This was a poor choice on my part and I understand that it may have seemed like I was working on something unrelated, which wasn‚Äôt my intention. I realize that I shouldn‚Äôt have looked at it and should have focused entirely on my group‚Äôs work. I sincerely apologize for this mistake and will make sure it doesn‚Äôt happen again.  

Overall, I take full responsibility for my actions and understand how they may have been distracting. I am genuinely sorry for both incidents and have been making an effort to improve my focus, participation, and teamwork since then.

## üí° How I‚Äôve Improved My Behavior  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Taking Initiative and Contributing Ideas  
After reflecting on my actions, I made a strong effort to contribute meaningfully to my team‚Äôs project. I was the one who submitted google form and came up with the initial idea of **teaching Media Literacy** for our coding project. I discussed with my team how this topic could be presented in an engaging and educational way, and how it could be modeled after the **Plagiarism lesson** from your lesson.  

I really wanted our project to be both relevant and impactful, so I thought deeply about how Media Literacy connects to social media and digital citizenship, topics that you emphasized in class.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Building and Designing Our Project  
On the second day, I drew our storyboard for the Media Literacy plan. I also researched on **College Board** to identify which concepts from **Unit 3** were most relevant to our game. I worked with my teammates to figure out how to incorporate these ideas into our design in a fun and interactive way.  

That same day, I **presented our Media Literacy planet concept** to the class, explaining what our planet would include:  
- A **game to identify fake vs. real news**  
- A **media bias checker**  
- A **source-combining feature** that cross-references news stories across multiple outlets  

While some of these ideas have since evolved, they served as the foundation for what our project storyboard became.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Technical Collaboration and Problem Solving  
On the third day, I **cloned our group repository** and engaged in discussion about how we would structure our files and start implementing the code (we didn't focus a lot on this as that's a future task). I also reached out to **Shuban Pal** to see if we could use and adapt his existing game for our own project. He hasn‚Äôt responded yet, but I took the initiative to contact him and continue to follow up with my team.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Visual Design and Game Mechanics  
On the fourth day, I worked with my team to create a **visual representation of the game** on the whiteboard. I helped write and draw the storyboard to make sure all three of our missions were included and clearly connected to the gameplay.  

We also brainstormed key details together where I suggested that each correct answer should reveal **one number in the vault code**, and that parts of the code could be **auto-filled based on corresponding missions** so participants could move more efficiently through the planet.  

These contributions show how I‚Äôve made a consistent effort to communicate better, stay focused, and take responsibility for my role in the team.

## üåü Final Thoughts  

I want to sincerely apologize again for my actions earlier in class. Since then, I‚Äôve worked hard to show improvement through consistent participation and collaboration. I‚Äôve taken initiative, helped organize and design our project, and made sure to contribute ideas that help our team succeed.  

Moving forward, I‚Äôll continue to uphold this standard of staying focused, contributing thoughtfully, and respecting class expectations. I understand that one of the most important skills in CSP is failing quickly and recovering, and experiencing growth in both technical abilities and behavior. In this way, I'm focusing on improving in both areas.
